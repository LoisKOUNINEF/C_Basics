A long time ago, Frodo lived in Shire.
One day, Sauron came in Shire and killed Frodo's family.
As a result, Frodo decided to go in Mordor for revenge.
Frodo travelled 394 days long before reaching Mordor.
Sauron expected no less, but nonetheless, Frodo was able to defeat him and burned Mordor to the ground before returning to his homeland Shire.
